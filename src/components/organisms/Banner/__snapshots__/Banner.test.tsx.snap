        <p>
          Technology is where I live. I also love anything to do with space.

          Will our species ever reach Alpha Centauri? Propulsion technology has come a long way since we last went to the Moon. A simple laser-powered lightsail? Theoretically this could reach 20% speed of light (0.2c). So Alpha Centauri in a cool 21.41 years. Not sure about the return journey though...

          Time dialation? 0.44 years. And roughly half an hour away via radio contact...
